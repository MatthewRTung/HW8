Peer Review

The provided interfaces IScheduleFrame and ISchedulePanel present a structured approach to handling the view
components in a scheduling application. The segregation of frame and panel responsibilities indicates an attempt
to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, which is commendable. However, the methods in IScheduleFrame,
such as findUserByName, suggest an overlap of concerns, as this method appears more suited for a model or a
controller than for a view. The use of interfaces for the view components is good for abstracting implementation
details and promoting flexibility in swapping different view components.

The method names and their intended functionalities are mostly clear, aiding in understanding the purpose
of each component. However, methods like setClientListComboBox in both interfaces could benefit from a
more descriptive name indicating their action more clearly, such as updateUserListInComboBox. The method
addUsersToComboBox returns a JComboBox, which seems slightly out of place for an interface that represents
a panel; typically, such UI components would be internally managed rather than exposed.

The documentation across the interfaces is concise and generally informative, providing clear descriptions of
what each method is supposed to achieve. However, the documentation could be enhanced by specifying more
details about the parameters and the expected state of the application when methods are called. For instance,
updateSchedule could elaborate on how the events list is used or any preconditions like sorting or
filtering requirements.

The interfaces provide a solid foundation for a modular view component structure in a scheduling application.
To further improve, consider refining the separation of concerns, enhancing method responsibilities to be
more resilient to various states, and ensuring that UI components are managed in a more encapsulated manner.
By addressing these areas, the code can achieve higher maintainability and scalability.
